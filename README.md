## Students will present their homework/projects as either:
* Their own Python scripts
  * They can use any IDE of their choice
* Use Jupyter and hence, Anaconda (Miniconda)
  * This has more flexibility when looking to install future packages and languages to Jupyter, such as R, C, etc.
  
In either case, the code can be checked against test cases to see if the student has succeeded in solving the homework/project.

## Datasets

Datasets to be used will be those from the authors of the book, [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html), as well as any other well-documented source, e.g., [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). More datasets can be easily found online, but historical datasets carry some weight and have already been cleaned/preprocessed.
