## Students will present their homework/projects as:
* Their own Python scripts
  * They can use any IDE of their choice
* Use Jupyter and hence, Anaconda (Miniconda)
  * This has more flexibility when looking to install future packages and languages to Jupyter, such as R, C, etc.
  
In either case, the code can be checked against test cases to see if the student has succeeded in solving the homework/project.
